Let me break down what we just accomplished:

Setup Development Environment

Installed Homebrew (macOS package manager)
Used Homebrew to install Node.js and npm
These tools are essential for modern web development
Project Build Process

Your project is built with React + Vite (modern web development tools)
When you ran npm run build, it:
Compiled your React components
Bundled all your JavaScript/TypeScript files
Processed CSS and other assets
Created a dist (distribution) folder with optimized static files
What's in the dist folder?

HTML files (like your index.html, but optimized)
JavaScript bundles (minified and efficient)
CSS files (compressed)
Any other assets (images, fonts, etc.)
Why This Matters

Your original React code isn't directly readable by browsers
The build process converts your development code into production-ready files
GitHub Pages can only serve static files, which is exactly what we've created
These optimized files will load faster in browsers
Next steps will be to configure GitHub Pages to serve these files from your repository. Would you like me to guide you through that process?
